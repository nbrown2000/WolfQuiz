## üì• Importing a Quiz from JSON

You can use `import.py` to import questions into an existing quiz in the database.

### How to Use

1. Make sure a quiz with the target name already exists in the app by using the quiz creator button.
2. Open `import.py` and locate this line:

   ```python
   QUIZ_NAME = "GBUS 325 Exam 3"
   ```

   Replace the value with the exact name of the quiz you want to import into.

3. Your JSON file should be named `gbus325_exam1.json` or you can modify the filename in the script:

   ```python
   with open("gbus325_exam1.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
   ```

   *You can keep the name as-is if you like, or change it to your filename.*

4. Run:

   ```bash
   python import.py
   ```

### JSON Structure

```json
[
  {
    "question_text": "What is the capital of France?",
    "is_true_false": false,
    "correct_answer": "Paris",
    "false_answers": ["London", "Berlin", "Madrid"]
  },
  {
    "question_text": "The sky is blue.",
    "is_true_false": true,
    "correct_answer": "True",
    "false_answers": []
  }
]
```

- `question_text`: The question itself.
- `is_true_false`: `true` or `false` depending on question type.
- `correct_answer`: The right answer.
- `false_answers`: A list of incorrect answers (empty if it's True/False).
